Hello, I'm Alex. I'm 22 and I'm from Singapore. I'm a Computer Science major under <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg"> Nanyang Technological University's</a> Premier Scholars' Programme. I love to code, crack puzzles and build cool stuff wherever i go, which explains my interest in Software Engineering. My current interests are in software development, systems & infrastructure, and algorithmic problem solving. I'm always learning more about operating systems, distributed systems, computer networks and algorithms.

Apart from code, I enjoy travelling the world, chatting about ideas, music, board games, and of course, a good game of tennis. I'll be spending some time attached to <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/"> UC Berkeley</a> in the San Francisco Bay Area. If you'd like to work on a project together, do let me know.

I mainly write about code, tech, or really anything i found interesting or helpful. I hope you'll enjoy the site!
